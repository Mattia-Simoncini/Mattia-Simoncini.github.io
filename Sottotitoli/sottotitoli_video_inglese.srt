00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,980
In this video we talk about the criterion 3.1.3 unusual words level AAA.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,740
This criterion is a criterion of guideline 3.1 Readable

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,960
in fact, we must always make the text readable and understandable to everyone ...

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,580
For more information on this guideline

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,220
compare the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines website

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,340
(WCAG) 3.1 and go to www.w3.org

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,480
Now let's look at criterion 3.1.3 in detail

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,360
this criterion makes available to the user

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,980
a mechanism to identify specific definitions

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,720
words or phrases that have been used in an unusual or restricted way.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,420
These words also include idiomatic and slang expressions

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,540
The techniques sufficient to meet the criterion are divided into two situations which are ...

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,980
the situation a, when the word or phrase has a unique meaning within the web page

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:17,120
and situation b, when the word or phrase means different things within the same web page.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,200
The techniques sufficient to satisfy situation A are the following:

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,040
we have four sets of techniques and the G101 technique is common to all four.

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:37,400
The first set of techniques is made up of technique G101, G55, H40 and H60.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,220
The G55 technique presents us with providing a link to the definitions of words used in an unusual or restricted way.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:55,200
He in turn divides himself into the H40 technique, that is to provide descriptive lists of all the words used in an unusual or restricted way

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,560
and the H60 technique, i.e. the use of the link element to link to a glossary where all these words are collected

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,620
and generally the glossary is located at the bottom of the web page.

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,240
The second set of techniques is made up of techniques G101, G112 and H54.

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,320
The G112 technique tells us to provide built-in definitions

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:31,880
while the H54 technique tells us to use the dfn attribute to identify the instance of a definition of a word.

25
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,280
The third set is composed of the techniques G101 and G62.

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:47,920
The latter technique tells us to provide a glossary in which all the words used in an unusual or limited way are collected.

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,580
The fourth and final set of techniques is composed of techniques number G101 and G70.

28
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:04,940
Technique number G70 tells us to provide a function to search in an online dictionary for unclear words for the user.

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:15,040
And now that we have given a first smattering of these techniques we are going to analyze them in detail one by one, also showing examples for each of these techniques.

30
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,100
Let's start by analyzing the technique number G101 which is common to all 4 of the set of techniques.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,160
The technique tells us to provide the definition of a word or phrase used in an unusual or limited way.

32
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,740
a word is used in an unusual or limited way when ...

33
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,260
dictionaries provide different definitions of the word

34
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,800
a specific definition must be used to understand the content

35
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,180
the author creates a new definition that must be used to understand the content.

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:58,620
Now after analyzing the technique number G101 we are going to analyze also showing some examples all the remaining techniques of the situation A.

37
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:09,700
As a first technique we have the number G55 which tells us to provide a link to the definition of a word used in an unusual or limited way.

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:20,060
The goal of this technique is to make the definition of a word available, establishing a link between the word and its definition

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,160
as you can see alongside we have an example of application of this technique

40
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,300
in fact in the sentence Antonio did the math without the host and now he pays the consequences

41
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:38,800
we can click on "done the accounts without the innkeeper" and clicking on them opens a new page where the definition of this sentence is provided

42
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,160
and with this example we can see much better the connection that is created between the word and its definition.

43
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,380
now we have technique number H40

44
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,760
which is an implementation of the G55 technique analyzed previously.

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,860
Technique number H40 tells us to use descriptive lists.

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09,940
the goal of this technique is to provide the description of names or even terms by presenting them within a descriptive list

47
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,780
The descriptive list to be used is marked by the use of the dl attribute

48
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,800
then within this list you have to use 2 other types of attributes which are ...

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
the dt attribute and the dd attribute

50
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,820
every term in the list is inserted inside the dt attribute

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,080
while the corresponding description is inserted in the dd attribute

52
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,220
Furthermore, we can also use the title attribute to provide further information on the descriptive list

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,220
alongside we can see a real application of this example

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:55,420
and as you can see better from the code in the following image we can see much better the use of the attributes explained above.

55
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,460
In fact, we used the dt attribute inside which we inserted the words that need to be defined

56
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,980
and inside the attribute dd we have inserted the description of the word

57
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,820
and with this code it is possible to display the following descriptive list on the web page.

58
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,500
Now let's analyze the technique number H60 which is another possible implementation of the G55 technique

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,420
The H60 technique tells us to use the link element to provide the link to a glossary.

60
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,540
The goal of this technique is to provide a mechanism to locate the glossary

61
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,540
and the glossary is referenced through a link to the part of the web page where it is contained.

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:51,220
alongside we can see better the use in fact in the sentence during data backup the CPU could overheat too much

63
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,320
we have two words whose definition is contained in the glossary and these two words are: backup and CPU.

64
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,020
in fact after these words we can visualize the written search in the glossary

65
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:11,140
that by pressing on brings to the bottom of the web page where the glossary with all the words contained within it is presented.

66
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,580
Then let's analyze the technique number G112 which tells us to use the built-in definitions.

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,360
the goal of this technique is to put a definition in the context of any word used in an unusual or limited way.

68
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,400
this definition can be provided in the text, just before or immediately after the use of the word.

69
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:42,680
as you can see better from the example shown here, we have a phrase in which we have used a built-in definition

70
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,740
in fact in the sentence during the basketball game the player Rossi suffered the fracture of his metacarpal

71
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,320
immediately after the use of the word metacarpus we provided the corresponding definition.

72
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,760
An implementation of technique G112 is technique number H54

73
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:10,260
which tells us to use the dfn attribute to identify the instance of a word definition.

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:20,580
The goal of this technique is to use the dfn attribute to mark the use of a word or the use of a sentence in which it is defined.

75
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,480
Later you can better see the use of this attribute

76
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,360
in fact we can see that in the inserted sentence the three words which are the C ++ language

77
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,440
they are written in a slightly different font than the rest of the sentence

78
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:44,820
in fact, seeing better from the code shown in the following figure we can see that the 3 words whose font is slightly different are written inside the dfn attribute

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,140
while the rest of the sentence does not.

80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,980
The penultimate technique presented is the number G62 which tells us to use a glossary.

81
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:03,880
The goal of this technique is to make the definition of a word, phrase or abbreviation available by providing the definition in a glossary.

82
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,120
A glossary is an alphabetical list of words and is very often included at the end of the web page.

83
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:24,520
as you can see better from the example shown here we have a sentence and in this example as in the example of the H60 technique we have a word whose meaning is contained within the glossary

84
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:37,080
in fact, by pressing on the word search in the glossary present after the word altercation in this case you scroll the whole page up to the bottom where the glossary is contained.

85
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:47,520
the last technique presented is the number G70, this technique tells us to provide a function to search for the word in an online dictionary.

86
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,740
The goal of this technique is to provide the user with a mechanism to access an online dictionary on the web page.

87
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:08,000
as you can see better in the example alongside we have a sentence in which a word of it in this case pen-drive has the word search in the dictionary available

88
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,140
that pressing on it opens a new page with the online dictionary treccani

89
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:21,280
within which we can look for the definition of the word whose meaning we have not clear.

90
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now that the techniques of situation A have been presented showing an example for each one, let's analyze the techniques of situation B.

91
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,840
First let's say when situation B occurs

92
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,520
situation B occurs when the word or phrase has different meanings within the same web page.

93
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:51,060
The techniques sufficient to satisfy this technique are composed of two sets of techniques for a total of 7 techniques

94
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:59,100
and also in this case as in situation A we have the technique G101 which is common to both sets of techniques.

95
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,080
and analyzing better we can see that the remaining techniques are also the same as in situation A

96
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:17,550
however when we go to analyze the examples one must realize that situation B occurs in another case and therefore even if the techniques are the same the application in the two situations are different.

97
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:27,120
The first set of techniques of situation B is composed of techniques G101, G55, H40 and H60.

98
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,980
As explained previously, the G101 technique tells us to provide the definition of a word or phrase used in an unusual or limited way.

99
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,240
while the G55 technique is a possible implementation of the latter

100
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,560
and tells us to provide a mechanism for linking to definitions

101
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:59,040
moreover this technique can be implemented both with the technique number H40, that is to use the descriptive lists and with the H60 technique use the link element for the connection to a glossary.

102
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,940
The second set of techniques is made up of techniques G101, G112 and H54.

103
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,140
This time the G101 technique can be implemented with the G112 technique

104
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,960
which tells us to use the built-in definitions

105
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,000
and in turn the technique number G112 can be implemented with the H54 technique

106
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,420
that is, use the dfn attribute to identify the instance of a word definition.

107
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,240
now that we've shown enough techniques to satisfy situation B

108
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,380
let's show the examples for each of them showing all the differences between situation A and situation B.

109
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,820
As a first technique we analyze the number G55

110
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,160
which as you can see better from the explanation tells us to use a link to definitions.

111
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,620
An example of application of this technique in situation B is shown alongside

112
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:07,380
in fact the difference with situation A lies in the fact that in situation B we have two same words to which the technique is applied.

113
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:20,300
In fact, in the sentence I love fishing but I also like fishing both words fishing can be clicked and once pressed on them the definition for that particular word is shown.

114
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:33,680
In fact if we press on the first word fishing a new page opens showing the definition of fishing which in this case is intended as the search for and the capture of animals

115
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:47,260
while pressing on the second word peach a new page will be opened also in this case but in this case the definition that is shown is different in fact the definition of peach intended as fruit is shown.

116
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:55,900
In fact we can see that two same words can have different meanings within the same page

117
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,060
and therefore it is appropriate to specify the meaning of each of these words.

118
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:11,380
We then analyze the H40 technique which as we have seen for situation A tells us to use descriptive lists

119
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,360
In fact, a descriptive list is brought alongside as in the example of situation A

120
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,320
but inside it in this case we have two equal words which however have different meaning

121
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:33,420
in fact we have the word head which once means head intended as the person who commands while once it means head intended as part of the human body.

122
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,040
We also used the same attributes to show this list on video which are shown in the following image.

123
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,120
and with the code shown in the figure we have shown the following descriptive list on the web page.

124
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:58,980
Now let's analyze another implementation of the G55 technique or the H60 technique that tells us to provide a link to link to a glossary.

125
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:05,200
in fact at the side we can see an example of this technique applied in situation B

126
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:18,220
in the sentence just arrived in fly I found a fly inside my jacket both the first and the second word fly have a link that connects the word with the glossary located at the bottom of the web page.

127
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,780
in fact, pressing on the word, search in the glossary after both words fly

128
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,320
the link that leads to the bottom of the page where the glossary is present will be activated

129
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:37,620
and it is possible to see that the first word moscow is intended as the capital of Russia while the second word moscow is intended as an insect.

130
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:47,700
Now let's analyze the technique that tells us to use the built-in definitions or let's analyze the technique number G112.

131
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:58,160
And as it is possible to see better in the example alongside also in this case we have two equal words within the same sentence which in this case are put

132
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:07,420
and both after the first and the second word we have the built-in definition of the corresponding words.

133
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,440
In fact in the first case mass means the religious rite while in the second case in means the operation of collecting cereals.

134
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:32,940
As a last technique we are going to analyze a possible implementation of the previously analyzed technique or the technique number H54 that tells us to use the dfn attribute to identify the instance of a definition of a word.

135
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,420
And as an example we have two equal words that were written inside the dfn attribute

136
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,580
as you can see better from the code we used to provide this example

137
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:57,280
in both cases we have the word bait but in the first case we mean bait as a means of attracting animals while in the second case we mean bait as a verb to exit

138
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:12,880
now that the techniques sufficient to satisfy both situation A and situation B have been presented showing also examples for each of them we can correctly apply all the success criterion 3.1.3

139
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,380
I hope I have been as clear as possible and thank you for your attention.
